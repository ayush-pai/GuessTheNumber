GuessTheNumber is a number-guessing game in which the user must guess the computer's randomly generated number, which is between 1 and 1000. 
The project features both text and visual outputs to show the user if the number they have guessed is higher or lower than the computer's number. This project was created using Python and Python Turtle.
